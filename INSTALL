Installing GWorkspace
=========================

GWorkspace requires GNUstep to be installed. Make sure that you have an
up to date version on your system installed! 

Some classes needs the FSNode framework so you need to install this first:
    
    cd FSNode
    make install

now you can build the other things:

		cd ../
    ./configure
		make install

		If you want to do make; make install, make sure that you
		first make; make install GWLib, and *then* the rest of the
		sources!
