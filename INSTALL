Installing GWorkspace
=========================

GWorkspace requires GNUstep to be installed. Make sure that you have an
up to date version on your system installed! 

		cd GWorkspace
    ./configure
		make install

		If you want to do make; make install, make sure that you
		first make; make install GWLib, and *then* the rest of the
		sources!
